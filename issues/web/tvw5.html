					<h3>The last issue of the Spring '25 semester is upon us</h3>
					<p>
						Good lord.
						We're already at the last week of classes.
						Are you ready for summer? Because we sure are!
						Unfortunately though,
						that means this is the last issue this semester.
						Thank you again for supporting us throughout the last month and a week!
						Anyway, without further ado, a rundown of the news this week.
					</p>
					<p>
						All seemed well and good in the first half.
						It had been a very nice week in the tech dumps;
						however, on <time datetime="2025-04-17">Thursday</time>,
						disaster struck in the tunnels.
					</p>
					<p>
						We'll start with the bad news.
						As of <time datetime="2025-04-17">Thursday, April 17th</time>,
						a camera was installed in the JEC&ndash;DCC tunnel
						by the DCC entrance doors.
						It's unclear why they installed them <i>now</i> of all times,
						but we may update you on the situation further
						prior to the semester's end if anything changes.
						The hope is that this will end the same as the 9th floor of the CII stairwell,
						where a gate and camera were installed roughly 5&ndash;7 years ago
						(according to the Campus Exploration Manual),
						both of which have been since removed.
					</p>
					<p>
						In better news,
						the JEC has had quite a large dump of electronics and cables this week,
						along with 3 CRTs, 1 PC monitor, and 2 TVs&mdash;one even with FM radio!
						Plus, the VCC has had a truckload of laptops,
						most just working.
						Read more about it in What's new in the box(es).
					</p>
					<p>
						We at <i>Tunnel Vision Weekly</i> are very sad at the news of the cameras,
						and are hoping that this will blow over as quickly as it started.
						Good luck on finals, have fun over the summer,
						and hopefully we'll see you next fall
						for <i>Tunnel Vision Weekly</i>&nbsp;#6!
					</p>

					<h3>What's new in the box(es): Laptops, laptops, laptops!<br />Find of the week: DIY mirror out of HDDs!</h3>
					<p>
						Lots of stuff has just been piling in these past few weeks.
						This week is no exception.
						It really does seem that the end of the semester is the best time for the tech dumps.
						The JEC has had a huge dump of 1 PC CRT monitor, 2 CRT TVs, and 1 huge flatscreen TV.
						There's also been a huge heater, and cables for days, plus a bunch of scrapped laptops.
						The VCC has been even better, with at least 7 laptops found, mostly varying models of ThinkPad.
						All that's gone are the HDDs and batteries in pretty much all of them.
					</p>
					<p>
						In finds of the week this week,
						we're going to look at a very neat mirror,
						if you have the tools to get to it.
						We sure do, so be sure to grab one while they're still available in the DCC tech dump!

					<h3>State of the Art: <em>Disaster strikes JEC tunnels: camera installed</em></h3>
					<p>
						Holy moly guacamole. I was not expecting this.
						On <time datetime="2025-04-17">Thursday</time> morning,
						when entering the JEC&ndash;DCC tunnels,
						I was hit with a sign reading "Camera!"
						directly underneath a fresh new security camera.
						It is unclear whether the admins or someone else took down the signs
						when I looked again on <time datetime="2025-04-18">Friday</time>.
					</p>
					<p>
						This week in State of the Art,
						despite the camera,
						we've got a lot in store for you.
						Not only was there still some art made before the camera this week,
						but we've got a few throwbacks to show from earlier this academic year!

						For the unlucky ones out there,
						you're gonna have to do Arch this summer.
						On page 4 is a guide on how to have a not-so-bummer Arch summer!
						As the spring semester comes to a close,
						sophmores have one thing on their minds: Arch.
						Some of you are feeling grateful you've managed to get out of it;
						as for the rest of you,
						it's probably not the summer you were hoping for,

				<h2 class="silkscreen-bold">What's new in the box(es): end-of-semester edition</h2>
				<p>
					Holy moly,
					these last few weeks really have been the best time of the semester
					to go to the tech dumps.
					The VCC has not stopped its absolute scale of giveaways:
					laptop here, iPad there, let's throw in a working PC, why not?
					Not only that, but the JEC has had a big dump of cables, CRTs, and laptops as well.
					How many PCs can one building hold?
					We're finding out week by week as more and more stuff gets thrown out.
					Keep your eyes peeled,
					there could be a lot coming into the dumps before move-out day!
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, I myself have a lot of stuff I have to put back,
					as unfortunately, I cannot take all the stuff I want home with me.
					Be ready for some laptops, VCRs, and more
					as I clear out a bunch of stuff I'd love to keep,
					but don't have the space for.
					With all that out of the way, onto the rest of the section!
				</p>
				<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">Find of the week: ooh, shiny</h3>
				<p class="lede-large">
					We had a pretty great week this week,
					so it was tough to pick just one thing to feature,
					but I think this is a great parting gift for you all as you march onto summer!
					I know it's not much compared to iPads last week,
					but <abbr>IMO</abbr> it's better than just dropping a single laptop
					or something for only a single person to find.
					Plus, I for one love how shiny these things are
					and think they look great in any space.
					You could even make it into a necklace if you really wanted to!
				</p>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">Where to find</h4>
				<p>
					You should be able to find these beauts in the DCC tech dump,
					just somewhere in there.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternatively, if you have a star-shaped bit,
					all you have to do is unscrew the (usually 6) screws
					on the top of the HDD,
					peel off the top&mdash;it may be screwed in,
					so twist it around a bunch if it's not going&mdash;then unscrew the axle,
					and slide it out!
					The VCC has a ton of HDDs left if you've got the tools!
				</p>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">What to do</h4>
				<p>
					Stare at it until you realize the meaning of life.
					Or hang it up somewhere as a mini-mirror,
					or display it as a display piece,
					or even use as a necklace!
					The possibilities really are endless with this neat part.
				</p>
				<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">What's actually new in the box(es)</h3>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">JEC</h4>
				<p>
					3 CRTs,
					one of them being a CRT PC monitor capable of 1600 &times; 1200,
					and the other two being normal TVs.
					Also found was 1 big flatscreen, actually working,
					plus a ton of VGA/other cables.
					The 3 CRTs worked great,
					except for this neat Panasonic VCR/FM radio combo TV,
					which is a real shame.
					Besides that, 3 laptops, all mostly gutted by the time I got there,
					were also seen, as well as a Dell Inspiron.
				</p>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">VCC</h4>
				<p>
					Walking into the VCC has been like walking into a closing Best Buy.
					It's been a few weeks, and they are still throwing working stuff out here!
					The latest finds are mainly a <em>lot</em> of laptops.
					We're talking 5 <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t440s">ThinkPad T440s</a> models,
					a T410 and a <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t430">T430</a>,
					2 <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-x-series-laptops/thinkpad-x131e">x131e</a>
					models, and a Dell Latitude.
					Plus, at least 10 degaussed HDDs, ripe for the picking
					(if you want a mirror for yourself)!
				</p>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">Union</h4>
				<p>
					A <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/product-details/en-us/product/optiplex-gx270/overview">Dell OptiPlex GX270</a>
					was sitting there in a box on <time datetime="2025-04-18">Friday</time>,
					along with a singular speaker, 2 very old remotes,
					a <abbr title="uninterruptible power supply">UPS</abbr>,
					a cheap old keyboard, and an LCD monitor.
					First new stuff here in a while, so it was quite a surprise to see!
				</p>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">Elsewhere</h4>
				<p>Literally like nothing. Not mad, just disappointed.</p>

				<h2 class="rock-salt-regular">State of the Art&nbsp;: Camera installed?!</h2>
				<p>
					I&nbsp;don't know about you,
					but a camera in the DCC&ndash;JEC tunnel is not a good sign.
					It looks like art here may slow down considerably
					for as long as the camera's here.
					Though, I have seen a good bit of activity here despite the camera,
					though a lot smaller-scale art than usual.
					We'll see if people will just disregard the camera,
					or if the art will remain small for a while.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyway, luckily there is only one camera in one tunnel,
					so the other JEC tunnel is unaffected,
					and so are the other areas in which art has been found in the past,
					such as West hall and the 9th floor stairwell in Low.
				</p>
				<p>
					One last thing, <b>a quick correction to last week:</b>
					The duck-finding challenge will only give $15
					to the first person who finds both.
					I apologize for this typo, nobody has found them yet, though!
				</p>
				<p>
					Hope you enjoy the (rather more sparse) art from this past week!

				<h2 class="faster-one-regular">Tunnel Vision: Out of the Tunnel</h2>
				<h3 class="faster-one-regular">How to have a not-so-bummer Arch summer<br />&mdash;by anonymous</h3>
				<p>
					With 2 years on campus under your belt,
					you no doubt know how to survive the harsh winters of upstate New York,
					you know how to bundle up and keep warm,
					but do you know how to handle RPI in the heat?
					During the traditional academic year (fall and spring)
					there is at most a month or two (in total) of truly warm weather,
					and the rest of the time is either cold or unbearably cold.
					While there is a lot to be said for sledding and snowball fights,
					there is only so much time you can partake in winter activities
					before you lose an appendage to frostbite.
					During the arch summer, clear skies and 95 degrees Fahrenheit
					(that's 35 Celsius) is the new norm.
					Spending time outdoors in the sun is a privilege
					not easily afforded to RPI students,
					so let this be your guide to making the most of your summertime
					while at RPI.
				
				</p>
				<h3 class="faster-one-regular">Beating the Heat</h3>
				<p>
					Nothing beats the heat like an ice cream cone (or cup).
					If you venture into downtown Troy,
					the Dutch Udder serves up a wide variety of rotating flavors,
					from mint chip to sweet potato pie,
					as well as specialty items like root beer floats and donut sandwiches.
					If the thought of having to walk up the approach in the heat to get back to campus is deterring you,
					the closest Stewarts is only about 5 minutes' walking distance
					and always has solid ice cream options,
					offered on the cone or in pints.
					If you're looking to venture out a bit further,
					The Snowman, established in the 1950s,
					offers a variety of homemade ice creams, yogurts and sherberts.
					A long-standing institution in Troy, and only open seasonally,
					it's definitely worth checking out while you can.
				</p>
				<h3 class="faster-one-regular">No Car, No Problem</h3>
				<p>
					Every Saturday morning the Troy Farmers' Market takes over downtown.
					This impressively-sized event is a great way to spend a morning
					before that afternoon heat starts to beat down.
					Once it does start to beat down, head for a stroll along the Troy waterfront,
					taking advantage of the cool breeze coming off the Hudson.
					If the river's breeze isn't cutting it,
					step into The Arts Center of the Capital Region located conveniently at 265 River St
					for some air conditioning and funky art exhibits.
					If you prefer dirt over pavement, less than 5 minutes from campus at the bottom of 13th sits
					Prospect Park.
					Complete with scenic views of downtown, basketball courts, tennis courts and a massive disk golf
					course,
					this is my personal favorite place to spend a sunny day in Troy.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you're looking for something more refreshing,
					there is a spot not too far from Prospect
					commonly referred to by students as "The Gorge."
					45 Linden Ave is what you'll put into Google Maps to find this place.
					It is down the trail at the bottom of the parking lot.
					It's a quaint swimming hole enjoyed by RPI students throughout the years.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Danger: Going to the Gorge is trespassing, which is illegal.
						We are not responsible for any criminal charges that may occur if you go there.</strong>
				</p>
				<h3 class="faster-one-regular">Enjoying New York State</h3>
				<p>
					New York has a beautiful collection of state parks.
					Peebles Island, Thacher, Grafton, and Cherry Plain are all relatively nearby.
					A longer ways away but well worth the trip is Taghkanic State Park.
					In Durham, under Stone Bridge Road
					(put Stone Bridge Road into Google Maps),
					there is a swimming hole and a waterfall.
					It's deep enough at certain spots to jump into,
					with multiple outcroppings from which to jump.
					If you're looking for a more mild nature experience,
					Buckingham Lake Park, Lincoln Park, and Washington Park
					are all located across the river in Albany,
					the capital of this great state.
					There is also a huge collection of museums in Albany.
					The New York State Museum, The Capitol Building, University Art Museum, Albany Center Gallery, and
					Throop Pharmacy Museum
					are all free to the public and make for a great activity
					when it feels like there's just no escape from the heat.
				</p>
				<h3 class="faster-one-regular">Good Luck, Have Fun!</h3>
				<p>
					Less than 10 years old,
					the Arch program has become an infamous part of the RPI experience.
					There's no sugarcoating it:
					you're facing a standard 15 week semester's worth of coursework
					condensed into about 12 weeks.
					It's probably not the summer break you were hoping for.
					At the end of the day you'll get out of Arch what you put in.
					Hopefully now that you know what Troy and the surrounding areas have to offer,
					you can get the most out of this experience.
