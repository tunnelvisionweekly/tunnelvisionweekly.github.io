						<h3>It's the monthiversary of Tunnel Vision Weekly this week!</h3>
						<p>
						Psst. You there. Try to be quiet.
						We're setting up a surprise monthiversary party here!
						Didn't you know that <time datetime="2025-04-17">this Wednesday, the 16th</time>,
						marks a month since the first issue?
						I hope you at least brought <i>some kind of gift</i>.
						</p><p>
						We here at Tunnel Vision Weekly
						sure did bring gifts of our own this week.
						<b>We're giving away 8 iPad 4 models this week!</b>
						There'll be 2 in the DCC and 6 taped to copies of this week's issue,
						so keep a lookout!
						Just please only take one iPad is all I ask.
						</p><p>
						I gotta say though, if we're talking about gifts,
						you guys delivered us so many last week!
						I seriously can't thank you all enough
						for the cool stuff I've seen regarding Tunnel Vision Weekly
						over the course of last week.
						It was great to see the EHC's display of TVW,
						which has been hanging up each edition on their door,
						as well as someone who went out of their way to tape a copy to the Mercer X Lab!
						The awesome comments in the Tunnels were also very much appreciated,
						I see the RPI Furs liked the last issue, too!
						Within the first day, almost all the copies were taken as well,
						which was the most I've put out so far,
						which is super awesome to see.
						So thank you again,
						and I hope to continue to entertain you for many months to come!
						</p><p>
						As a final thing,
						did anybody read the latest <i>The Polytechnic</i>?
						I did, and I think it was pretty good!
						It's nice to see they're still printing at least <i>something</i> nowadays.
						Anyway, hope you enjoy this week's <i>Tunnel Vision Weekly</i>!

						<h3>What's new in the box(es): The VCC is going bonkers + roughly &infin;ft of cable in Low</h3>
						<p>Simply put, there was a <em>lot</em> in the VCC this week.
						The motherload, it could be considered by some.
						There were so many PCs there was no room for anything else.
						They were (mostly) complete, too.
						On <time datetime="2025-04-09">Wednesday</time>,
						the finds continued, with a lot of iPad 4 models.
						The PCs were quickly scrapped for parts;
						however, most of the iPads are fully functional.
						In the coming weeks,
						all or most of the iPads will be given away by TVW!
						</p><p>
						Read on page 2 how you can use iTunes to add apps to this ancient tech,
						allowing it to be surprisingly still useful!
						</p><p>
						Besides that,
						it looks like the JEC is truly done with its lab dumps,
						but Low has had a jump in finds, with <em>so</em> much cable.
						Perhaps you could even make a...swing with it?

						<h3>State of the Art: Ducks! Ducks everywhere! Tunnels out of order?</h3>
						<p>Shhhh. It's a secret.
						On <time datetime="2025-04-08">Tuesday</time>,
						I went to the library to study,
						and what did I find but 20 plastic ducks?
						The mission, should I choose to accept it,
						was to hide the ducks around campus.
						As far as I know, there are at least 200 ducks to find.
						Not sure if there's some master plan,
						but some of them have been stuck to certain copies
						of <i>Tunnel Vision Weekly</i> this week!

					<h2 class="silkscreen-bold">What's new in the box(es): Apple edition</h2>
					<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">Just when you least expect it</h3>
					<p>It's weeks like these that keep me going to the tech dumps, honestly.
					There I was, existing, right after the FOCS exam <time datetime="2025-04-09">this past Wednesday</time>.
					I was pretty tired, but I still decided to go on a little tech dump check.
					When I got to the VCC, I wasn't expecting much.
					Only when I got down there, I was treated to a plethora of iPads (10 or so), all freshly reset.
					And all of them just worked (except for 2 activation-locked ones),
					it was absolutely bonkers, as the cover says.
					In addition, on <time datetime="2025-04-07">Monday</time>,
					the EHC notified others of the dumping of at least 10 PCs,
					also in the VCC,
					all of which presumably had everything intact, besides the HDDs!
					</p>
					<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">Find of the week: (8) Apple iPads</h3>
					<p>iPads are heavy, or at least the iPad 4 is.
					You'd be surprised how heavy 10 of them are stacked on top of one another,
					but I digress.
					If you've been quick enough to snag an iPad for yourself,
					you may be wondering what you can do with it,
					seeing as it's so old. It's locked to iOS 10!</p>
					<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">First, a quick disclaimer</h4>
					<p>This is an old device&mdash;the batteries work fine,
					but they're over a decade old at this point,
					so I'd be at least a little more careful than usual with the batteries.
					Also, since it is iOS 10,
					it's probably not as secure as the most recent iOS,
					so just keep that in mind.
					Still fun to mess around with, though!</p>
					<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">What to do</h4>
					<p>The first issue I found with these
					was they wouldn't connect to the school Wi-Fi.
					Supposedly they can.
					I couldn't, so I used a hotspot on my phone to connect them to the Internet.
					Once I got that set, I was able to create an Apple ID,
					connect it to the iPad, and open iTunes and the App Store and all that.
					iTunes seems to work perfectly fine,
					but the App Store is a bit more of a struggle.
					If you want to install apps to this thing,
					you're going to have to do a slight workaround.
					What I had to do was install version 12.6 <em>or earlier</em> of iTunes on my PC,
					access the App Store through that, "get" the apps via that PC App Store,
					and then use the App Store on the iPad to
					install an earlier, <i>more</i> compatible version of the app via the "purchased" tab.
					Not all apps will work, but if you want to do some classic iOS gaming,
					this method should work well for most classic apps,
					especially those made before 2017/the
					release of i0S 11!
					</p><p>
					As a side note, YouTube works pretty solidly on these iPads as well.
					There isn't even lag (from my testing)!
					</p>
					<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">Where to find</h4>
					<p>I have attached 8 iPads to 8 copies of <i>Tunnel Vision Weekly</i>.
					I have also put 2 in the DCC tech dump.</p>
					<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">Bonus find: jump rope or tire swing from Ethernet cables</h3>
					<p>If you missed out on the iPads,
					but still want something fun to do,
					you've read to the right spot!
					Low on Thursday had the <em>most</em> cable I've ever seen deposited in one place.
					Literally filled a box.
					It's gotta be hundreds of feet...of fun!</p>
					<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">What to do</h4>
					<p>Grab the rope of tied-together purple Ethernet cables.
					Either hold with both hands and jump-rope away,
					or find a sturdy tree and make a rope swing!
					Bonus points if you find a PC, connect it to an Ethernet cable, and make a seat.
					These aren't the only uses for these cables.
					See if you can find others!
					If you feel you have found a great use for them,
					be sure to contact us at <a href="mailto:tunnelvisionweekly@proton.me">tunnelvisionweekly@proton.me</a>
					and your use might be featured in the next issue!</p>
					<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">The latest finds and stuff</h3>
					<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">JEC</h4>
					<p>There was not much here this week.
					A huge cabinet Was already tagged,
					a Samsung monitor still there.
					So many PCBs. So many.</p>
					<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">DCC</h4>
					<p>Not much this week.
					The printer from last week was taken,
					and really the only thing added was a vacuum
					and its carrying backpack (???).
					The spinning disk is back, at least!</p>
					<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">VCC</h4>
					<p>This was <em>the</em> week for the VCC.
					Over a semester of silence, relatively speaking,
					and this week happened to be the motherload of finds,
					quite possibly the best dump all year.</p>
					<p>I counted at least 10 desktop PCs,
					with RAM (most likely) and CPUs (definitely) included,
					as well as some lower-end GPUs.
					All DDR3-era stuff, but at least it was full.
					Only thing they got rid of were HDDs,
					which is probably a good thing, honestly.</p>
					<p>Also, of course, the iPads.
					All reset when found, so fresh install and everything, luckily.
					14 total found. All except 3 were iPad 4 models.
					I will give most of them away in the coming weeks,
					so be ready if you want one!</p>
					<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">MRC/Cogswell/Low</h4>
					<p>Cogswell seems to have been partially cleared,
					with the AC and Swiffer being removed,
					and 2 TVs being put in their place.
					Unfortunately, one has a cracked screen,
					and the other only turns on for a second, then turns off.</p>
					<p>The MRC has a MacBook Pro with a non-working screen
					and a Samsung tablet that also doesn't boot.</p>
					<p>Low has not had much.
					A server HDD rack, apparently,
					according to a picture in the EHC #techdumps channel.</p>

					<h3 class="rock-salt-regular">Ducks&mdash;they're everywhere!</h2>
					<p>I&nbsp;don't know about you,
						but I've noticed a few ducks on campus lately.
						I think I know why, though.
						On <time datetime="2025-04-08">Tuesday</time>, I became an appointed member of the "duck-hiders,"
						and as a result I think I have a duty to uphold.
						If you look around campus, you'll be sure to find some tiny plastic ducks hidden in various corners.
						I was studying in the library on <time datetime="2025-04-08">Tuesday</time>,
						and upon finding a study room,
						a plastic bag of plastic ducks found me.
						I was given a mission to hide the ducks around campus,
						and I gladly accepted.
						As far as I know, there are 200 ducks to find,
						but since I only got 20 ducks, each numbered,
						I have no idea if there were more. Pretty neat, though!
						</p><p>
						<b>If you are or know who is behind the ducks,</b> contact
						us at <a href="mailto:tunnelvisionweekly@proton.me">tunnelvisionweekly@proton.me</a>&mdash;we'd love to interview you about it!
						</p><p>
						<b>A little challenge:</b>
						If you can find ducks #194 and #184,
						send me a picture of where they are via email
						and you'll win $15!</p>
					<h3 class="rock-salt-regular">Tunnels out of order?</h2>
					<p class="lede-large">Have the tunnels come out of order?
					According to a few signs on the JEC tunnels, they are.
					As a precaution, the next time you visit the tunnels,
					tread lightly, in case of mechanical issues with the floors or walls
					that could put you at risk. Better to be safe than sorry!</p>
					<p>In other news, thank you again for the kind words on the wall&mdash;they
					were a nice surprise <time datetime="2025-04-10">Thursday</time> morning!</p>
					<p>The Trolley Problem seems to have hit a stalemate:
					no new terrorists have entered, but nobody has left.
					Perhaps both sides are hatching a new plan?
					Unfortunately, when requested for comment,
					all parties only gave us the thousand-yard stare,
					except for one of the terrorists,
					who made a remark you can read all about below.
					We are also still waiting for the President's response.
					Stay tuned for updates on the situation!</p>
					<p>Finally, a new poll has started,
					as well as updates to the already established ones.

					<h2 class="faster-one-regular">Tunnel Vision: Out of the Tunnel</h2>
					<h3 class="faster-one-regular">Student review of Ricky Montgomery Concert<br />&mdash;by anonymous</h3>
					<p>On <time datetime="2025-04-05">Saturday, April 5th</time>,
					Ricky Montgomery and Sean Solomon came to dear old RPI
					thanks to the efforts of UPAC Concerts,
					the student-run group responsible for bringing musicians to campus
					(check them out on Instagram @upacconcerts).
					If you, like the majority of students,
					didn't attend last week's show,
					allow me to fill you in on what you missed.</p>
					<p>Highlights included the live debuts of multiple songs,
					including unreleased tracks from both Sean and Ricky.
					Rather than using the multimillion dollar Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (<abbr>EMPAC</abbr>),
					a stage was erected in the ECAV gymnasium,
					which both Ricky and his opener made note of,
					as it apparently reminded them of being bullied in high school.
					The turnout was nothing spectacular,
					a crowd of under 150 RPI students
					as well as some hardcore fans who just really wanted to see Ricky.
					The woman in front of me filmed a single continuous video
					of the entire hour-and-a-half performance,
					just to give you an idea.
					One of the non-RPI affiliates brought a sign reading
					"I don't even go here I just love you Ricky".</p>
					<p>The combination of passionate fans and low crowd turnout
					made for a very intimate experience in the end.
					The opener, Sean Solomon, played his new single "Car Crash"
					and a number of songs that are not yet available to stream.
					He engaged with the crowd, telling the stories behind his songs
					and even having a few back-and-forth exchanges with audience members.
					Armed only with a guitar and a mini TV,
					each of his songs had an accompanying animation created by Sean himself.
					Fans of Ricky Montgomery, Jack Stauber, and cut//slack
					might want to check him out on Spotify or Apple Music.</p>
					<p>After Sean left the stage there were about 20 to 30 minutes of downtime
					before Ricky came out.
					During which time, speakers played pop songs
					that had been edited to include a robotic voice saying "Rick".
					"I can make the bad guys -Rick- for a weekend" ("Blank Space" by Taylor Swift).
					Around <time datetime="2025-10-20T21:05-04:00">9:05 PM</time>
					Ricky took the stage, opening with "Line Without a Hook."
					His performance did not disappoint.
					Speaking as someone who is only mildly familiar with his discography,
					and only knew the words to a few of the 17 total songs (full set list below),
					he is a great performer. He engaged with the crowd,
					even taking recommendations and changing the set list accordingly.
					He made sure to include favorites like "This December" and "Mr. Loverman"
					as well as some songs by The Honeysticks.</p>
					<p>Some fan highlights included "Last Night"&mdash;a highly requested song on his last tour,
					but he never played it because he was "scared"&mdash;and the live debut
					of "Penny Come Home."
					The second live debut was of "Change,"
					an unreleased song he decided last-minute to play for us.
					Once he finished he brought out copies of the set list
					that had been folded into paper airplanes and threw them into the crowd,
					a fun and (in my opinion) dangerous way
					for a handful of people to fight to take home a special souvenir of the night.
					That is, if you're a chump.
					The friend I attended the concert with (they're a big Ricky fan)
					went up to one of the crew members
					and asked if they could have a guitar pick that had ended up on the floor,
					to which the crew member happily obliged.
					Work smarter, not harder.
					Overall the concert was a 9/10,
					more than worth the 25$ ticket fee.
					Thank you, Mr. Montgomery!</p>
