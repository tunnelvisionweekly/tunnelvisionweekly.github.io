						<h3>The blurb of blurbs</h3>
						<p>&mdash;by I</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						Yippee, you made it!
						Welcome to the best decision you made today
						(picking up TVW #7, of course!).
						Before this weekend,
						there was more of a reason to say "Yippee,"
						the tunnel art was developing and lots happened in the tech dumps.
						Things changed over the weekend, though.
						There was a huge camera installation and mass painting in the tunnels.
						As a result (almost) all the art is gone...
					</p>
					<p>
						Nonetheless, besides that there's a lot in store
						for you all this week,
						a bunch of cool things happening in the tech dumps,
						as well as a new section.
						Lots of art saved from before the 3rd paintening, too!
						Also in this issue is a certain personality quiz...
						I'll leave you to find out about that one on page 5!
					</p>
					<p>
						This week, we're also announcing the debut
						for one of our new writers, Pi,
						writing for Subterranean Homesick Blues,
						a section dedicated to the underground music scene
						and the people who keep it going.
						Definitely worth a read, I enjoyed it myself!
					</p>
					<p>
						Thank you all for taking all copies distributed last week,
						hope you enjoy this week's edition of <i>Tunnel Vision Weekly</i>!

						<h3>What's new in the box(es):</h3>
						<h4>Literally new boxes, that's what</h4>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						If you felt that you missed out on the Low dump of stuff
						on <time datetime="2025-08-21">8/21</time>,
						here's another chance to get in on that action!
						Another 9 boxes got hauled into the Low tech dump hallway,
						all of them originating from other tech dumps.
						One had tons of old, old PCs,
						another all the tapes from the DCC, plus a CRT DVD-VCR combo.
						It was a very exciting day to tech-dump!
					</p>
					<p>
						As a quick note, on the #tech-dump channel
						on the RPI Free and For sale Discord,
						someone mentioned <strong>all of the boxes in Low
						will get hauled away on <time datetime="2025-09-15">9/15</time></strong>,
						so get there <abbr>ASAP</abbr> if you want a look for yourself!

						<h3>State of the Art: so much... paint?</h3>
						<p><b><em>Plus, cameras back!</em></b></p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						Paint everywhere (on the DCC&ndash;JEC tunnel),
						there's paint everywhere (on the wall)! Paint twice?!
						On <time datetime="2025-09-14">Sunday</time>,
						this has become thrice.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tunnel art really is a unique part of campus,
						a great way to see some of the culture shine through
						in the form of art.
						It's pretty funny to look at sometimes, too.
						Let's hope this increase in painting and security is all temporary
						like the 9th floor of Low's stairwell a few years back.
					</p>
					<p>
						At least there's a bunch of art that has been saved
						from before this 3rd paintening you can check out!

						<h3>State of the Art <em>Extra</em>: Cameras galore, paint everywhere</h3>
						<p>&mdash;By I</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						Everything in the JEC tunnels has been painted over.
						Except for tiny, more remote things, of course.
						Black spray paint was found covering most art
						in the JEC&ndash;DCC tunnel and half of the JEC&ndash;JROWL tunnel.
						The rest of the JROWL tunnel has also been painted over.
					</p>
					<p>
						11 cameras have been installed around the JEC tunnels, as well.
						It is unclear why this has happened,
						or if/when the cameras will be removed.
						Nonetheless, with the shocking frequency of painting and addition of cameras,
						it's safe to say surveillance of the tunnels has greatly increased.

				<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">Low Goes Crazy on <time datetime="2025-09-12">Friday</time></h3>
				<p>
					Sometimes, I lose hope that anything interesting
					will show up somewhere like Low,
					when nothing new shows up there for weeks at times.
					Then I go to Low on <time datetime="2025-09-12">an unsuspecting Friday</time>
					and find 10 or even 11 boxes of things waiting to be looked through.
				</p>
				<p>
					This week was pretty slow until <time datetime="2025-09-12">Friday</time>
					came through like a freight train.
					It appears that they emptied/replaced all the boxes
					(except for what seems like MRC/Cogswell/West's boxes)
					and just dumped 'em into Low.
					All the tech dump items you've seen for the past few weeks
					have found themselves in Low, in other words.
					Plus boxes that weren't before accessible, it seems.
				</p>
				<p>
					A box from the VCC was spotted being hauled away to a truck outside
					around <time datetime="2025-09-12T14:00-04:00">2 PM on Friday</time>.
					It had tons of really old Sun PCs and Dell Optiplexes (model GS, really old).
					Checking Low only a few hours before would have shown you nothing,
					checking around <time datetime="2025-09-12T17:00-04:00">5</time>
					or <time datetime="2025-09-12T18:00-04:00">6</time>
					would have shown you the literal motherload of stuff.
					Plus some new things that haven't been in the tech dumps before!
					If you're in the mood for an office photocopier,
					there are 2 in Low as of Friday.
					They're about 4 feet tall,
					and have a sign telling you to recycle them.
					There's probably a good chance they work,
					though I haven't tested them myself.
				</p>
				<p>
					Besides that day, <time datetime="2025-09-09">Tuesday</time>
					also had some JEC finds,
					you can read about that and the less exciting finds
					below in What's Actually New.
				</p>
				<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">Find of the Week: CRT TV/VCR/DVD Combo, Big PC Case, Old Sun PCs</h3>
				<p>
					I couldn't decide on just one find of the week,
					there was so much to choose from!
					The first find of the week this week
					was the CRT TV/VCR/DVD combo,
					since it worked perfectly, had vivid colors,
					and allowed us to see what was actually on some of the VHS tapes from the DCC.
					And to our surprise, it was not a bunch of <em>spicy</em> videos,
					it was actually a lot of old TV recordings!
					By the time I checked Low later on, the TV was already taken,
					but I'll never forget the precious time spent with it.
					The second find of the week was the biggest PC case
					I've ever seen in my life in Low,
					and the third multiple Sun PCs.
					I love the old "under-monitor" form factor the really old PCs have,
					and there were a lot of them.
