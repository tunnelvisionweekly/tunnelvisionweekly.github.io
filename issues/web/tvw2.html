				<article class="intro">
					<p>Look at us go, we're officially weekly!! Something <i>The Poly</i>
					hasn't done since 2018. Take that, <i>The Poly</i>!</p>
					<p>Anyway, <i>other</i> papers aside, I wanted to start by
					saying thank you all so much for taking all the copies of the
					first issue! Over the past few days, I laid out 12, and all
					of them have been taken in the first 3 days! It was so
					awesome to see that you guys were actually interested enough
					to grab it out of the tech dumps, or out of the tunnels.
					Thank you to whoever fished out the the drunk drunk goggle material in the DCC, that honestly made my day seeing that you took the
					time to do that. Also makes it a lot easier to find compared to the invisible object in the image I pushed out in the
					last issue, so thank you so much for that, too. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out. It's still there!</p>
					<p>In this issue, I'm going to cover what's been a lot of action in some of the tech dumps, including 2 DVD players
					in the Sage tech dump, and some neat lab equipment in the JEC tech dump. I also wanted to cover what I think is an
					interesting part of the art around campus: the art that nobody paints over or removes. I think it's reasonable to say
					it's 'paint-proof.' If you look around the less visible or more hard to reach places in the tunnels, you're bound to
					find someone wrote something there. And I think that's pretty cool! Hope you enjoy this issue, and I hope to see you next week for the third edifion of Tunnel Vision Weekly!</p>

					<h2 class="silkscreen-bold">What's new in the box(es): Laboratory Edition</h2>
					<p>I&nbsp;am not a scientist.
					There's probably like a 50% chance you're not a scientist, either (isn't this school like >50% CS majors??).
					One does not need to be a scientist to appreciate the lab stuff we got in the JEC last week, though!
					There was a great big lab equipment dump in the JEC and 2 DVD players (possibly broken, they turn on at least) in Sage.</p>
					<p>In the JEC, among the random 'radiation meters' (def instills a lot of confidence in my safety when digging through the dumps lol) and other analog dials, is a beautiful machine, which spits out whatever color you want. Read more in the next
					section if you're curious about that. If you dare reach into the toner-dusted depths of the box, you may be able to find
					some other interesting lab equipment that's been buried, and thus not yet found by others.</p>
					<p>Besides that, I tried to fix one of the DVD players in Sage, the Pioneer one, since it turns on, just no DVD reading
					or video. Let me tell you, there's a hell of a lot of screws. It might be as simple as adjusting the laser strength, but
					I am far too lazy to tear down this fine piece of tech to get that far, so it has been put back into Sage. Good luck, if
					you go for it, and contact me at <a href="mailto:tunnelvisionweekly@proton.me">tunnelvisionweekly@proton.me</a> if you actually get it working (or if you have any other
					neat gadgets that you got working from the tech dump for that matter)! It'd be cool to feature that next week!</p>
					<h2 class="silkscreen-bold">Find of the Week: Make all the colors with this One Cool Gadget!</h2>
					<p class="lede-large">Yes, it's true! With this one neat thingamajig,
					you can make what looks like every (monochromatic) color!
					<time datetime="2025-03-27">Last Thursday</time>, there was a huge dump of random lab stuff, looks like they had some kind of
					cathode and anode lab setup, radiation meters, stuff like that. Buried amongst these analog meters,
					which were cool in their own right, was a little gadget known as a <em>“High-Intensity Monochromator."</em>
					It's got a fun dial on the side that makes an analog number set go up/down, allowing you to select the
					nanometer light you want to make! I tested it out, and it looks like the dial goes from about 250 nm
					to 1770 nm, but the colors seem to cycle, so it's probably not very accurate, but it cycles through like
					every color. For obvious reasons, I can't show you the color capabilities of this thing. I'd say try
					out for yourself, but it was taken on <time datetime="2025-03-29">Saturday</time>, to my dismay.</p>
					<h3>How to do:</h3>
					<p>All you do is plug it in, flip the switch on the top, and then put something in front of the
					cylindrical hole on the bottom (see picture) It's fascinating, and makes some really pretty lights.
					Probably don't stare into it with your bare eyes, though.
					Other stuff found with it is this weird motorized shutter thing, all you can do is plug it in, and it
					starts spinning a disc inside, kinda fast actually, making anything seen through the window of it kinda
					have a strobe effect, 'till it spins too fast and then it's just pretty much normal again. Weird stuff,
					no idea what it's for. Also found was a lamp. A neat spotlight kind of lamp, you can take it out of its
					holster and stuff, it's got three modes, and it just seems pretty neat. No wonder both also got taken.</p>
					<h3>Where to get:</h3>
					<p>Unfortunately, despite moving them to the DCC in an attempt to keep them around at least a
					little longer, these three items have already been snagged by other fellow tech dumpers. For future item features, Tunnel Vision Weekly will be sure to store the items featured until the weekly release day in
					order to prevent this. Sorry! At least the DVD players are still in the Sage dump! At least the drunk
					goggle material is still there, in case you missed last week's issue.</p>
					<h2 class="silkscreen-bold">The Latest Finds and Stuff</h2>
					<p>Like I said, we had a lot thrown into the tech dumps this week.
					The breaking news last Monday was exciting.
					Too bad it was taken hours after I put it in,
					with the messages in #tech-dump removed entirely,
					minutes after I received them, around noon on Monday.
					Just goes to show, you never know what you'll find when you walk in.
					There could be a weeks' stretch between anything good,
					but on that day when you find a pristine PC, or a neat tech gadget that's fully working,
					it all feels worth it.
					Without further ado, here's the latest and greatest stuff that I found
					while wandering by the tech dumps last week!</p>
					<p><b>The JEC</b> had a sizable haul deposited last Thursday night.
					Lab equipment, like mentioned in the above section.
					The string lights from Issue #1 were also taken,
					with a 'steam valet,' whatever that is, taking its place.
					A paper shredder head w/ power cable cut has also been deposited recently.
					The right bin has seen no action,
					unless you count the Tunnel Vision Weekly issues that I tossed in there
					over the course of Monday and Tuesday.</p>
					<p><b>The VCC</b> monitors and printers are gone!
					Only scraps remain, <em>but</em> there are also some 7 ft. Ethernet cables, in their
					bags, scattered around the bottom, too.</p>
					<p><b>The DCC</b> has a few useful things,
					2 VGA cables and a very long yellow extension cord, as of last Wednesday.
					The string lights from the first issue were moved from the JEC to the DCC,
					not working, I suppose.</p>
					<p><b>LOW</b> has had literally nothing new, unfortunately.</p>
					<p>In a surprising twist, <b>the Sage lab</b> (the bins on the 2nd floor)
					has had 2 DVD players, both from the RPI TV club.
					One is a Pioneer DVD-V7400, something's wrong with it, though.
					It's got a sleek, boxed design, with all the outputs you'll ever want (except for HDMI).
					There's no display, but wonderfully clicky buttons and neat LEDS decorating the front, as well.
					Only problem is, it doesn't read discs. Guess that's just how it is sometimes.
					The other DVD player was actually a DVD/VCR combo.
					The DVD tray won't open, but if you need a VCR, I haven't tested it,
					but hey, it might work if you try!</p>
					<p><b>The MRC</b>, since the TV drop, has had nothing, and so has <b>Cogswell</b>.
					Though there is a swiffer wet jet&trade; and an old AC unit,
					which might be useful soon, let's hope!</p>
					<p>Besides that, it looks like that's all for this week. From the looks of it, big
					things could be on the horizon. Whenever tech dumps suddenly get more things put in,
					it can sometimes mean that they're beginning renovations of something, meaning that
					there's tons more stuff on the way. I'd say keep a special eye on the JEC and
					potentially Sage this upcoming week, seeing as they had a lot put into them recently!</p>
