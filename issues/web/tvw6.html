					<h3>What's new in the box(es): Summer Recap</h3>
					<p>On this week of What's New in the Box(es),
						<em>your</em> source of tech dump news,
						we're talking about a bunch of stuff that happened over the summer.
						Not only were there active patrols over the summer for certain tech dumps,
						there were tons of things put into Low right around move-in day.

					<h3>State of the Art: Bye Bye, Camera!</h3>
					<p>
						Over the course of the summer,
						lots happened in the tunnels.
						For those of you who read Issue #5,
						you may remember that this was the week
						that a camera was installed in the DCC&ndash;JEC tunnel,
						truly a bad day for tunnel art.
						Luckily, roughly coinciding with classes starting, the camera is gone!
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition, there was a DCC&ndash;JEC repainting,
						paving (or should I say painting hahahaha) the way
						for more art to show up over the course of the semester.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, a set of cool bigger art pieces
						were drawn over the summer,
						at least one of them coming from an artist who graduated this year.

					<h2 class="silkscreen-bold">What's new in the box(es): summer recap edition</h2>
					<p>&mdash;by "I" in collaboration with EHC</p>
				</hgroup>
				<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">The blurb</h3>
				<p>
					Welcome back sports fans,
					to the greatest sport known to gamblers and electronics thrifters alike:
					what I like to call tech-dumping.
					These past two weeks have been surprisingly active,
					with lots of cool stuff showing up in the tech dumps.
					A bunch of CRT monitors, VHS tapes,
					and other stuff I don't normally see.
					Read more about it below!
				</p>
				<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">The summer recap</h3>
				<p>
					In any case, let's get a rundown of what happened over the summer.
					According to a source from the EHC...
				</p>
				<p>
					The Department of Environmental Health and Safety (<abbr>EHS</abbr>)
					policed some of the big tech dumps (such as the JEC) over the summer,
					patrolling from <time datetime="10:00">10 AM</time> to <time datetime="14:00">2 PM</time>
					due to sensitive hard drive data being disposed of.
					Despite this, there were still items that were separated from patrol
					so that people could look through them.
					Eventually that stopped once the sensitive stuff was finally dumped properly.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for actual things,
					there were a bunch of Apple PCs being dumped over the summer,
					as well as other general computer parts.
					Not much action overall until around <time datetime="2025-08-21">8/21</time>,
					technically already past move-in for freshmen.
					Low received a whopping 7 boxes of <em>extra</em> tech dump stuff.
					There were mostly PCs there, unfortunately mostly gutted of parts.
					Before this even, there was also a mountain of things in the regular Low dump as well.
					Sounds like an interesting summer for sure,
					big thanks to the EHC member who let me know of all this!
				</p>
				<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">Find of the week: boatload of tape media</h3>
				<p>
					In the DCC dump, as of around <time datetime="2025-09-04">9/4</time>,
					there are boxes upon boxes of VHS, Betamax, TV broadcast tapes, Hi8,
					and other random formats for video.
					If you've heard of a format of video tape media,
					it's probably at the DCC!
					According to the EHC, there were a number of tapes containing,
					shall we say, <i>spicy</i> videos,
					but it looks like a bunch were also regular movies and TV recordings and stuff.
					There are even master tapes for broadcasting movies/TV!
					But there were also many unmarked tapes sitting there.
					Needless to say, I've never seen so many different tape formats,
					or just tapes in general, anywhere before.
					There's got to be at least 100 of 'em in there.
					Actually crazy stuff.
				</p>
				<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">What's actually new in box(es)</h3>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">MRC</h4>
				<p>
					The MRC has 3 laptops:
					a <a href="https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/pd012235-detailed-specifications-thinkpad-t43-t43p">Thinkpad T43p</a>, broken,
					an older Dell,
					and a 2010s-looking Lenovo,
					which is quite stripped down.
					Besides that, a few cassette tapes of what looks like music,
					as well as some data tapes which I've never heard of before.
				</p>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">Cogswell</h4>
				<p>
					Cogswell has at least 4 or 5 CRT monitors for the taking!
					2 Trinitron CRTs, too.
					Not only that, but there's also a huge flatscreen TV (probably broken),
					and a few PC cases.
					Also on the outside, not sure if it's for grabs, just interesting,
					are a few chemistry journals from the mid-'80s.
				</p>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">DCC</h4>
				<p>
					Think of a type of tape media.
					That type of media was put next to the boxes in the DCC.
					VHS, Video8, MiniDV, Betamax, huge TV broadcast tapes,
					and probably everything in between.
					Really neat! Worth a gander for sure.
					The supplies of tapes have been added to over the past 2 weeks,
					their first appearance around the first day of classes.
				</p>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">Low</h4>
				<p>
					It's pretty empty now,
					especially compared to the 7-extra-box dump of PC parts
					around <time datetime="2025-08-21">8/21</time>.
					<time datetime="2025-09-02">Tuesday</time> saw a big dump of LCD monitors in the right bin,
					they could still be there if you're in the market for one.
				</p>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">JEC</h4>
				<p>
					Disemboweled PCs, a flip clock, not much else.
				</p>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">VCC</h4>
				<p>
					Amazon Firestick found over the summer.
				</p>
				<h4 class="silkscreen-bold">West</h4>
				<p>
					Lots of PC cases and cut Ethernet cables.

				<h2 class="rock-salt-regular">State of the Art: Bye Bye, Camera</h2>
				<p>
					You're here to see the art,
					I'm here to document the art, tunnel art is great.
					'Nuff said. That being said,
					just wanted to report some news while I'm here.
					Over the summer, the DCC&ndash;JEC tunnels
					have been used as a storage place for heavy machinery,
					resulting in limited access.
					This may have been the reason that the camera was installed late last spring.
					Another reason, coming from an anonymous source in the spring,
					may have been due to the floor graffiti.
					It has not been confirmed the reason of the camera,
					but it is confirmed that you can rejoice that it's gone!
				</p>
				<p>
					Plus, the DCC&ndash;JEC tunnels have been repainted
					near the start of this semester,
					leaving a blank canvas for the inevitable drawings to come.
					I'm excited to see what's going to unfold!
					Plus, the terrorists from the spring's Trolley Problem have left,
					as have the victims, safe and sound.
					In an interview with the victims,
					we asked if the lever was pulled or not.
					Unfortunately the answer has been redacted by the FBI.
				</p>
				<p>
					In other news,
					the lights in the DCC&ndash;JEC tunnel seem to be in the process of being replaced.
					It's too bad, the fluorescent lighting was less harsh
					than the LED lighting they're putting in.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hope you enjoy the art on display this week!
					Some of the most intricate drawings I've personally seen
					so far, bravo to those who drew the big ones!

				<h2 class="faster-one-regular">Tunnel Vision: Out of the Tunnel: Welcome back!</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome back or welcome to RPI!
					Hopefully you had a rejuvenating summer.
					Dear old RPI certainly did.
					For this first edition of the semester
					I wanted to catch you up on all things Rensselaer.
				</p>
				<h3 class="faster-one-regular">Games Room update</h3>
				<p>
					Although still technically under construction,
					the old Games Room has been given a major makeover.
					The first thing you'll notice is the all-glass paneling they added
					for a more open feel in the front.
					In the middle they've added a bunch more seating and tables.
					On the leftmost end there is a lounge titled the "Pre-Function Lounge."
					Presumably they will come up with a more specific function soon,
					but currently it features couches and smaller tables for a more relaxed vibe.
					It is through this lounge that you can access the new theater.
					On the opposite side, where Mother's used to be,
					they have pool tables and ping-pong tables,
					as well as more seating to watch people play.
					I think the most exciting addition to this space is the e-sports room.
					Complete with couches and large television screens,
					in addition to a huge table with at least eight monitors,
					this place is perfect for all sorts of gaming events.
				</p>
				<h3 class="faster-one-regular">Walkway under construction</h3>
				<p>
					The elevated walkway that spans the JEC is under construction,
					causing major delays
					as people try to navigate through the building instead.
					It's unclear how long the project will last,
					but given the pace and the ultimate goal of redoing that whole section,
					assume it'll be out of commission for the foreseeable future.
					To avoid getting stuck,
					I'd recommend going around the building completely.
				</p>
				<h3 class="faster-one-regular">Serial pisser on the loose at RPI</h3>
				<p>
					The trend of filming yourself peeing on school property
					has found its ay to RPI.
					@Rpip1$$&euro;r67 on TikTok has already filmed themselves
					"allegedly" peeing on both the Union and on Crockett.
					This is one of multiple accounts doing this trend,
					and as far as we know,
					the administration hasn't caught wind of the alleged incidents.
				</p>
				<h3 class="faster-one-regular">Prospect Park</h3>
				<p>
					Prospect Park has undergone some fairly major renovations as well,
					including a new playground, updated tennis courts,
					and the addition of pickleball courts.
				</p>
				<h3 class="faster-one-regular">New Logo</h3>
				<p>
					But perhaps the most significant change facing RPI students this semester
					is the unveiling of our new logo.
					Sometime early to mid-August,
					President Marty Schmidt unveiled this new logo
					along with a media campaign to back this rebranding.
					The new logo features the letters RPI over a bar.
					The letters "RPI" are written in a custom weight
					of the <a href="https://lineto.com/typefaces/replica">Replica font</a>
					and remain consistent across the many iterations of the logo.
					The bar however is where we see creative liberties being taken.
					This bar is supposedly a nod to the surveyor's rod
					featured in the center of the original seal
					and is the focal point of the new logo.
					The rebranding campaign features iterations of the logo
					with different types of bars
					representing everything from Delaunay triangulations to wavelengths.
					The administration is also encouraging student clubs to tailor the 500&times;36px space
					to represent their organizations.
					For inclusions to the official logo library,
					only black-and-white versions will be accepted.
