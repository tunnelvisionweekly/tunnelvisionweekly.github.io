						<h3>Welcome back to Tunnel Vision Weekly!</h3>
						<p>Welcome back!
						The logo has changed yet a third time,
						and the front has reverted pretty much back to the first issue's design.
						I feel like this all kinda flows better.
						Only thing that kinda sucks is I don't know where to put any pictures on the front,
						but maybe I don't need any.
						Let me know what you think,
						I'd really appreciate any feedback via the QR code in the bottom right corner!</p>
						<p>Anyway, whoever drew all over the JEC tunnels on Sunday night,
						<i>why couldn't you do it like the day before???</i>
						I get that Sunday night is like, before Monday,
						but then I gotta wait a week (or rewrite the paper within a night) to fix it..
						Oh well, at least there's a lot to cover this week!</p>
						<p>In the big ol' boxes, the JEC tech dump finds just keep comin',
						except it looks like the lab stuff has finally stopped.
						It all culminated in the arrival of the holy grail (in my opinion),
						a CRT monitor and some early '90s looking PCs!
						You just don't see those monitors even in the tech dumps anymore,
						it's unfortunate, really.</p>
						<p>Meanwhile, the tunnels have had, like I said,
						a lot of action on Sunday,
						with some extra stuff going on throughout the week.
						Could this be a new set of hands? I guess we're yet to find out!</p>
						<p>I hope you enjoy this issue of Tunnel Vision Weekly,
						unfortunately I had a lot less time to edit this week,
						but hopefully this should still be a decent read.</p>

						<h3>What's new in the box(es): No more lab stuff?</h3>
						<p>Oh, if you thought the lab dumps were over, you're probably right, honestly. Though this week might've had the climax of the whole event: A CRT and 2 Pentium II PCs were dropped in the JEC, taken so fast I didn't even have a chance to see them! Besides that, a printer in the DCC, and some other random goodies thrown around.</p>
						<p>For the finds of the week, we've got an interesting one for ya, if you're fast enough! It's an analog multimeter, placed in the DCC by Tunnel Vision Weekly, seems to not work, though, but it could be a cool display piece...</p>
						<p>Also on page&nbsp;2, my take on CRT monitors, seeing as there has been one recently dumped in the JEC!</p>
						<p>...Read more on page&nbsp;2!</p>
					</article>
					<article id="slot3" class="preview">
						<h3>State of the Art</h3>
						<p>Another interesting week in the JEC tunnels!
						A terrorist crisis has erupted over the Trolley Problem,
						as well as signs telling others to 'RUN' spanning the ENTIRE tunnels.
						There's way more than that, head over to page&nbsp;3 to read more!
						I think the tunnels are almost full at this point,
						way more than last time, even.
						Could this mean paint soon? I guess we'll have to find out...</p>
						<p>...Read more on page&nbsp;3!</p>

						<h3>Tunnel Vision: Out of the tunnel</h3>
						<p>Have you ever wondered what the tunnel art used to look like?
						Perhaps you even remember some of these old tunnel arts!
						Mere hours after the first issue came out, we got an email,
						which led to the exchange of a lot of old photos from the tunnels.
						If you wanna see what the tunnels looked like in some places...</p>

					<h2 class="silkscreen-bold">What's new in the box(es): The Lab - Is it dumped?</h2>
					<p>I&nbsp;love CRT monitors.
					They're a relic of the past that most people have cast away
					in favor of newer, sleeker flatscreens.
					I mean, it makes sense.
					There's a lot to hate about CRTs,
					for one, their weight.
					Seriously, it feels like any decently sized CRT computer monitor
					weighs at least 50 lbs.
					Plus, they are boxy and quite difficult to fit on a lot of desks.
					They're thick. Quite thick.
					If you can look past that, though,
					I think there's a lot of stuff that has been taken away from us
					that once was commonplace with these monitors.
					For one, they are quite possibly indestructible.
					I heard a story of someone dropping one of them from a staircase,
					and it literally still worked.
					You can tap the screens with your finger
					without worrying about cracking the glass, too, that's for sure.
					Plus, you can technically set it to any resolution without issue
					(though some monitors get blurry at too high of a resolution),
					and you can actually get infinite color depth,
					due to the analog way that it displays things!
					I wish CRTs were still in use in some capacity,
					but alas, it was not meant to be, I guess.
					If you have the space and arm strength to get yourself a CRT monitor or TV,
					I'd recommend it!</p>
					<h2 class="silkscreen-bold">Find of the Week: Analog Multimeter - probably broken, though :&#40;</h2>
					<p class="lede-large">Unfortunately,
					I was not able to find anything super neat for you all this time around,
					buut I still managed to find an analog multimeter to look at!
					It seems to be broken, but it lights up,
					and I'm sure with a bit of fiddling, it'll work like new!
					You can find it now (unless someone claimed it) in the DCC tech dump!
					To probably nobody's surprise,
					the drunk goggles are still in the DCC dump as well!
					If you don't know what I'm talking about,
					head on over to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/tvw-archive">https://tinyurl.com/tvw-archive</a>
					and read the drunk goggles article in Issue #1.
					It's pretty neat, and I think it's still worth an experience if you haven't already seen it!</p>
					<h2 class="silkscreen-bold">The Latest Finds and Stuff</h2>
					<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">JEC - lotsa lab stuff</h3>
					<p>Lotsa stuff continues to be thrown out.
					Last Monday, a CRT monitor and 2 Pentium II PCs were thrown out!
					Unfortunately, I was not there in time to see them for myself.
					I found the information in the EHC Discord server's #techdumps channel.</p>
					<p>There were also these neat fluorescent lamps,
					I dropped one off in Low.
					Plus, a Thinkpad T61, horrifically torn apart,
					was also found on Saturday,
					as well as a 4-HDD hub?
					Unfortunately that's all I know about it,
					it's gone now..</p>
					<p>Finally, the lab equipment,
					looks like the last of it for a
					while, has been tossed, some of
					the last stuff includes some
					neat Kodak film stuff, over 60
					years old!</p>
					<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">DCC - printer and finds of the week</h3>
					<p>The table I distributed Issue #1 on has <em>disappeared</em>!
					It looks like 2 of the copies went with them
					(hopefully to read).</p>
					<p>Also, found on Saturday
					was a boxed Brother laser printer,
					it says 'OLD PRINTER' only not the original box!</p>
					<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">VCC - Ethernet cables and PC</h3>
					<p>The VCC had a great find this Monday,
					with a <em>full</em> Dell Dimension 4600
					(minus the HDD)!
					CPU and 1 GB DDR RAM still inside,
					plus 2 CD drives and a floppy drive!
					Quite a solid-looking machine, I woulda taken it
					if I didn't have enough PCs already.
					It was gone the next time I checked on Wednesday,
					unfortunately.</p>
					<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">MRC/Cogswell/Low - literally nothing</h3>
					<p>Nothin'. These seem to be the least active of all,
					and have been all semester, ever since the big lab dump in the MRC.</p>
					<p><b>Correction from Week 1:</b>
					The TV from issue #1 had its picture taken
					in the EHC #techdumps channel,
					not the free and for sale server!
					The picture is still up, too. My bad!</p>
					<h3 class="silkscreen-bold">West - new coverage!</h3>
					<p>This is the first coverage of West Hall's tech dump!
					I figured I'd add a quick blurb about it here, not much.
					It was recently mostly cleared out,
					leaving behind toner cartridges and boxen and loose electronic parts,
					but nothing really of value.
					I honestly don't think I've ever gotten anything interesting from there.
					Oh well.</p>

					<h2 class="rock-salt-regular">State of the Art - Terrorists Hold Trolley Problem Hostage</h2>
					<p>Tensions have risen at the Trolley Problem this last Sunday
					when <em>terrorists</em> seized control of the lever,
					rigging it with explosives.
					Locals are nervous, to say the least.
					Negotiations have been going on as we speak,
					the terrorists say they're not gonna pull the lever,
					while the crowds have been mulling over if that's the right choice.
					Negotiators have been stumped by this, as well.
					If you or someone you know is good at negotiating,
					contact us and we'll see if you can help solve this crisis!</p>
					<p>In other news, "<em>run</em>," according to words
					written all the way down the JEC tunnel between Saturday and Sunday night.
					Similarly, there have been lots of repeated phrases appearing all over.
					The polls have even been written over!
					Plus, more columns and votes have been added.
					I hope the fact that the tunnels are actually nearly full
					doesn't mean paint soon.
					That seems to be what happened last time,
					fingers crossed there'll still be some time before the end of the semester!
					We at Tunnel Vision Weekly will be sure to keep you updated,
					so stay tuned!
					Anyway, hope you enjoy the art I'm showcasing this week,
					and as always, if you havy any art to share,
					contact us via the QR code on page 1 or via email!</p>

					<h2 class="faster-one-regular">Tunnel Vision: Out of the Tunnel - but this week, still in the tunnel!</h2>
					<p>Furries.
					According to popular belief, furries lurk among us,
					hiding axound campus, putting around stickers, et cetera.
					According to my LA last year,
					the JROWL-JEC tunnel used to be called the "furry tunnels."
					Not sure how valid that is, lol,
					but it is what they said on a tour of campus.
					Lately, there hasn't been a whole lot of that kind of art around the tunnels, at all.</p>
					<p>They're definitely still around, though.
					Only an hour or two after the first ever distribution of Issue #1, I got an email.
					It was from the RPI Furs, the furry club on campus.
					Pebbles, a member there, wrote that
					"the animal people of RPI have a very long tradition
					of decorating the tunnels (and other places...) with art and stickers,"
					and then offered to send some pictures my way.
					It's actually crazy to me how fast they found a copy.
					In the spirit of journalism and archival, I accepted.
					Below you'll find select snippets of art of tunnels long gone.
					Thank you again for the submission,
					if you have any art you wanna share from the tunnels,
					contact us at <a href="mailto:tunnelvisionweekly@proton.me">tunnelvisionweekly@proton.me</a> or the QR code!</p>
