						<h3>Hi there!</h3>
						<p>Hey! You there! Yeah, you! Did you know
						that you stumbled on the greatest (<i>okay, okay,
						technically the only paper</i>) source of RPI tech
						dump and tunnel art information out there? A
						place where you can get to know what's going on
						in the depths of the tunnels? And it's <em>free</em>?!
						Take this stick of DDR2 RAM as a gift, from me to
						you, for reading this and taking this paper with
						you to wherever the tunnels take you. Prepare
						yourself for a journey of a lifetime as you
						experience RPI like never before in this weekly
						paper! Keep reading to find out the latest drops
						at (almost) all the tech dumps, as well as the
						newest art and maybe even some news around RPI!</p>
						<p>You may be wondering, why? Why make a paper
						that's just about the stuff down here? Why make a
						paper at all? To the latter question, I don't
						really know. I've always wanted to make a paper
						or some kind of publication, and this idea struck
						me as actually feasible. I know you can
						technically go down there yourself and explore
						it, BUT I think I can still provide value by
						(hopefully) getting more perspectives from others
						(including me), as well as maybe some wacky and
						fun tips and tricks I come across, too!
						Either way, thank you so much for taking this
						paper with you and reading it. I had fun making
						it, at least, and I hope this provides at least a
						little value to your life.</p>
						<p>(Also I thought it'd be kinda funny to try to
						make semi-serious news about the tunnel art lol)</p>

						<h3>What's new in the box(es)? Latest tech dump finds from the past week</h3>
						<p>Especially around this
						time of year, there doesn't seem to
						be very much in the tech dumps.
						Unless I go check at the wrong
						times, who knows? If you're
						anything like me, it can be very
						tempting to go check the tech dumps
						around campus, but sometimes, you
						just don't have the time to check
						every single one. <i>Wouldn't it be
						nice to get a snapshot of the tech
						dumps without going there myself?</i></p>
						<p>If you've ever asked
						yourself this, you're in the right
						place! In each edition of Tunnel
						Vision Weekly, I'll give my take on
						the new stuff in the tech dumps
						over the past week that isn't
						documented anywhere else! I'll
						cover the JEC, DCC, LOW, VCC, and
						sometimes Cogswell, MRC, and West
						Hall tech dumps. Occasionally stuff
						is posted in #tech-dump on the RPI
						free and for sale discord, but the
						info can be sparse there, to say
						the least. If you want to find maps
						of where to find the tech dumps,
						it's there, though.</p>

						<h3>State of the Art - JEC Tunnels</h3>
						<p>You ever just slowly
						pan across the JEC tunnel, looking
						at all the new stuff people drew?
						When the painters inevitably erase
						all of the art that has been
						building on the walls, isn't it
						kinda sad?</p>
						<p>In my opinion, it would be
						nice to be able to see the state of
						the art in the tunnel (wowowowow
						that's the name of the section!) as
						the weeks go by. Let's keep the
						masterpieces of today available to
						the students of tomorrow!</p>
						<p>This may answer questions such
						as, “Who owned the rented space
						first?” “How has the number of
						straight/gay/<wbr />potato/cat people
						fluctuated over time?” “Where will
						the mysterious eye show up next?”
						and many more like that. On page 3,
						there will be a collection of
						photos of the current tunnels as
						they are.</p>

						<h3>TECH DUMP TRINKETS 1:<br />Science teachers hate this one trick! Make your own drunk goggles with this tech dump item!</h3>
						<p>Here at RPI, alcohol is hard to come by.
						What if you still wanted to experience the
						effects of alcohol without the drinking (middle
						school alcohol PSA style)? In the DCC right now
						(maybe), and in pretty much every cheap monitor,
						there's a monitor part just waiting to grant you
						free (or cheap) drunk goggles!</p>
					</article>
					<article id="slot5" class="preview">
						<h3>Help wanted for paper</h3>
						<p>I&nbsp;really want to be able to run this paper,
						but I fear that this is much too much work for one person.
						If there's anyone out there who wants to help me run this
						thing, I'd <em>really</em> appreciate it. Even if it was a few
						minutes of your time proofreading, editing, writing, or
						helping design the layout, any help will be greatly
						appreciated! Any articles would also be graciously accepted
						via email or QR code, as well.</p>
						<p>If you're interested, use the email or QR code below to
						apply. Just let me know what you want to help with when
						contacting me. You can help anonymously or have credits, I
						just would like to have some more experienced people help me
						on this endeavor!</p>

					<h2>What's new in the box(es)? (cont.)</h2>
					<p>I&nbsp;go to the tech dumps too much. It's like gambling, but free. The tech dumps here at RPI have
					lots of free stuff. All of it is free, actually. Except the box (don't ask me how I know :/). Sometimes
					perfectly working PCs; many times, the scavenged remnants of them. You never know what you're gonna get
					when you walk through those JEC doors, or down the hall of the DCC. It makes me sad to see perfectly good
					tech get thrown out, and I think if more people would know what's where, when, it may help rescue some
					tech from destruction, or salvage some neat trinkets from already broken stuff. It'd also be cool to see
					what you all may have found yourselves! Maybe you fixed up a neat gadget, or repurposed parts for a
					different thing? I wanna hear about it, and publish it here!</p>
					<p>With that out of the way, onto the recent stuff I saw in the past week! It'll probably be easier
					to list it instead of show, but I'll include some pictures for the curious. There has been a little bit of
					an influx of new in the JEC dump.</p>
					<p>A few days ago, <b>in the JEC dump</b>, I saw an old PC, 2 IDE hard drives intact, full of some DDR1 (I
					think) RAM, a floppy drive, and a CD drive. I came back later that day and it was gone, though. This could
					mean more PCs are on the way, though. I also found the remnants of a record player. It was pretty gutted,
					and gone the next day. There's some string lights and a heavy thing mover w/o the wheels (dolly?), too.</p>
					<p><b>The DCC dump</b> has been very quiet for quite a while, from what I've seen. Ever since those
					projectors were thrown out along with the barrage of wires, there's really been nothing of actual value,
					just broken metal casings and remnants of electronics left at this point. The industrial fan thing with a
					handle was cool, though!</p>
					<p><b>LOW</b> has had pretty much nothing new, but it usually doesn't, anyway. Bunch of nondescript garbage,
					basically. There's a halfway bent flatscreen TV in there, though. If you're looking for free glass shards,
					that's where you can look.</p>
					<p><b>The VCC</b> has a few good-condition-looking VGA monitors and a printer last time I checked, but
					besides that there isn't much.</p>
					<p><strong>TODAY, BREAKING NEWS:</strong> <b>A flatscreen TV</b> has been discovered <b>in the MRC</b> that appears to be fully
					working. It is uncertain if the picture-taker took the TV, but if you're in the market for one, check it
					out!</p>
					<p>That's all for now, folks! Go to page 3 for a neat use of monitor parts from the DCC dump! See
					anything interesting that I missed? Have a cool project from tech dump parts? Use the QR code or send me
					an email with what you found, and I'll try to feature it in the next (or later) editions!</p>

					<h2>State of the Art - JEC Tunnels (cont.)</h2>
					<p>Ever since the repainting a month or so
					ago, the tunnels have been filled up pretty
					fast with all kinds of art once again. The
					Taylor Swift lyrics spanning half the
					tunnel have evolved since the repainting,
					as it now includes pictures to make it more
					interesting. The cult of the eye, as some
					people speculate, seems to be going strong
					as there are plenty of these around campus, seemingly
					everywhere, really. The space for rent has claimed a
					lake/pond, and there's plenty of other text and pics
					scattered around. Stoned cat has also been around again. Did
					you complete the straight/gay/cat poll? What about the
					Commons/Sage/starve poll? Be sure to submit your answers
					before the repaintining! Below are more notable art pieces I
					figured I'd share. I did my best to keep them big enough to
					make out.</p>

					<h2>DIY Drunk Goggles from tech dump items! (cont.)</h2>
					<h3>What is it?</h3>
					<p>Honestly, I don't know. There's this really magical plastic sheet that comes from monitors that
					I've found in the tech dumps recently. It's like this magnifying-looking sheet of plastic. It's got ridges
					and stuff, and if you've seen one of those page-size magnifiers, made of that thick, yet bendy plastic, it
					looks and feels like that. Only when you put it to your face, a pretty wild thing happens. Your entire
					vision <i>shifts</i>. It's like you are suddenly in the third person. You look down, and your legs are almost out
					of view, near the bottom of your vision! If you rotate the sheet, you can get other wild effects, such as
					doubled vision, and others.</p>
					<p>I have no idea what this magic sheet of plastic is doing trapped inside a monitor, but I do know
					that it's really fun to mess around with. If you've ever messed around with drunk goggles in grade school,
					it's like that, but at like the strongest setting imaginable. Try to walk in a straight line with it, I
					dare you!</p>
					<h3>Where to find?</h3>
					<p>I found a sheet of this mysterious material in the DCC tech dump, it's got a footprint on
					it. That's probably the most specific I can be about it, besides the other stuff I said about it. In the
					picture below, you can see a closer look at where I last saw it. It's a mostly transparent-looking sheet
					with rainbow effects on it when you put it up to the light.
					You can find a picture of where I found it and an example perspective with it below.</p>
					<h3>What to do?</h3>
					<p>Like I said, all you gotta do is put it on your face. Maybe wash it first, but you can cut it
					out and stick it into some custom-made goggles, or just tape it to your face for maximum effect.</p>
					<p>In conclusion, the next time you see a taken-apart monitor in a tech dump, take a second to look for this
					gem of a find!</p>
					<p>Got any suggestions for interesting uses for things, or neat projects to showcase? Shoot me an email or
					upload it at the google form from the QR code!</p>

					<h2>Free and for sale listings/ads</h2>
					<p>Below (in the future) you're gonna (hopefully) be able to find listings that popped up in the RPI free and
					for sale, as well as any ads that may want to be put up! For now, though, there isn't really anything
					here.</p>
					<p><b>Advertising is free (for now)! The QR code is your friend.</b> Do you have an ad you want to place? Use the QR code on the first page to submit an ad! If there's nothing illegal or anything like that
					on it, I'll be sure to post it on the next edition of Tunnel Vision Weekly!</p>
