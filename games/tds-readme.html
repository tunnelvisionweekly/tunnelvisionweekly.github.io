		<hr />
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>To begin Tech Dump Simulator, simply open the .html file provided. It shuold open in browser. It uses HTML, CSS, and JS exclusively.</p>
		<p>You can set the difficulty whenever you want, using the dropdown at the top.</p>
		<p>If you want to start digging around the tech dumps, you need to tell the program where. So just click on the left button, and input the location you want to go. Case insensitive.
		Once you do this, you can click on the button to the right of that button, and... yeah you can read I'm sure.</p>
		<p>Each tech dump location has different luck rates and item rates, so you get a different amount of items from each one! You can only visit a tech dump once a day, so once you've
		exhausted all of them, be sure to go to bed!</p>
		<p>With each new day comes fresh opportunities at your local tech dump. As well as surprises! Be ready for unexpected challenges and decisions as you try to get to the tech dumps!</p>
		<p>Some surprises are good, while others, well, not so good. You'll have to find out for yourself!</p>

		<h3>Selling items</h3>
		<p>Selling items is simple in Tech Dump Simulator. To do this, simply click on the 'sell your wares' button. 
		This will take you to a menu where you pick a number. The number you use is the number in the square brackets in the inventory listing.</p>
		<p>If you're ever confused on what item is what, there's an item listing, including item values, next to the sell button!!</p>

		<h3>Progressing through the game</h3>
		<p>The ultimate goal of this game is to pay for your RPI tuition, which is a whole $100,000. Quite a bit. Not if you can manage your finances!</p>
		<p>In order to progress through the game, the shop is crucial. You can buy cosmetic upgrades and health boosts, but most importantly, laptops and stores. </p>
		<p>You see, you're a business tycoon in this game, getting their start selling some tech dump items. Then you can move on to online businesses, and soon enough even brick-and-mortar stores! 
		With each laptop and store you buy, you can increase your daily income!</p>
		<p>Plus, if you're reeeealy got some luck, you may be able to find a golden Tunnel vision #10, worth $1,000,000 (in-game, of course)!</p>
		<p>Once you win, we can email you a certificate of completion, perfect for any resume buffs out there looking to up their game! We're just going to need your game log and screenshot.</p>

		<h3>Miscellaneous features</h3>
		<p>If you want to save the memories of your game, you can copy/paste your game log, located at the bottom of the webpage, into whatever text application you want!</p>
		<p>Plus, when you buy your first laptop or store (whichever comes first), you can make a company name! Be careful though, it's $2,000 to change it! Patent offices are strict, y'know.</p>
		<p>When you buy a display case in the store, you can change your background color using the text box that appears!
		If you want to get a full-red background for example, just type "ff0000", no '#' or any other characters, then press the 'Change Background' button!</p>
		<p>Be careful with your health! If you go below 0, you die, and have to restart. Such is the life of a tech dumper!</p>
