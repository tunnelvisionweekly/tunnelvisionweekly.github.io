			<h2>What is Tunnel Vision Weekly?</h2>
			<p>
				Tunnel Vision Weekly is a biweekly (formerly weekly) newspaper,
				distributed every other Monday in paper and published digitally at the end of the same week.
				We started publication in <time datetime="2025-03-24">March 2025</time>,
				and currently have 6 sections.
				Our current circulation comfortably sits at around 40.
			</p>

				Are you curious about what people threw out over the past week?
