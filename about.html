		<h3>What is Tunnel Vision Weekly?</h3>
		<p><i>Tunnel Vision Weekly</i> is a BI-weekly (for now) newspaper, distributed in paper every other Monday, and
			digitally at some point during the week here, on this website. We started publication in March 2025, and
			currently have 4 BI-weekly sections. Our circulation currently comfortably sits at around 40.</p>
		<h4>Our sections!</h4>
		<p><b>What's new in the box(es)</b> is a section all about the tech dumps. Are you curious about what people
			threw out over the past week? That's where you look. Also included is a little opinion piece about the
			latest stuff that happened, as well as the find(s) of the week: stuff we find in the tech dumps that are
			saved and put into the DCC tech dump as a showcase for the week.</p>

		<p><b>State of the Art</b> is a section all about the art of the tunnels connecting most of the main campus
			buildings. All the latest drawings that popped up over the past week, and an expert analysis of what the
			drawings mean.</p>

		<p><b>Tunnel Vision: Out of the Tunnel</b> is a section about anything else, basically. In Issue #2 we featured
			an article submitted to TVW, as the inaugural article for this section. Issue #3 focused on the art of the
			past, also submitted to TVW.</p>

		<p><b>Subterranean Homesick Blues</b> is a section authored by Pi, it is a section focusing on the underground
			music scene and the people in it. It's a new section for Fall '25!</p>

		<p><b>Geologic Fever</b> is a section authored by S.S. Illite, about rocks and geologic features around campus.
			It's a new section for Fall '25, its debut being in issue #9!</p>


		<p><b>Puzzles n' Stuff</b> is a section about games and stuff that you can play once you're done with your paper
			(or while you're reading if you're cool enough). It's a new section for Fall '25.</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Who are we?</h3>
		<p>We are a group of RPI students dedicated to providing the RPI community with a weekly news source, or at
			least a little bit of entertainment each week. As of Fall '25, we have 3 people confirmed as regular
			writers!</p>
		<p>We've got names too, y'know!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I, founder and CEO of Tunnel Vision Weekly in March of 2025. I writes for What's new in the Box(es) and
				State of the Art.</li>
			<li>Virginia, second member of Tunnel Vision Weekly, having joined during issue #2. Virginia writes for
				Tunnel Vision: Out of the Tunnel.</li>
			<li>S.S. Illite, third member of Tunnel Vision Weekly, debuting (hopefully) soon. S.S. Illite plans to write
				for the rock section [currently unnamed].</li>
			<li>Pi, fourth member of Tunnel Vision Weekly, they are writing for Subterranean Homesick Blues, starting in
				Issue #7.</li>
			<li>A currently anonymous contributor is helping us fix up this website! Be ready for updates in the coming
				future!</li>
			<li>Honorable mention: K is the person who submitted the current logo to us, modifying a previous logo
				design by I, adding the eye in the middle. The original logo design was inspired by West Virginia's
				original sketch. Thank you again!</li>
		</ul>
		<!--<p>Actually, it's just <i>I,</i> for now. I'm a sophomore at RPI, who goes to the tech dumps and through the tunnels a lot. And I have always wanted to make something like a newspaper. I also feel like physical media is a lost art, which is returning somewhat, but it feels like it has very much been lost. For example, the Poly has stopped printing after over 100 years, which I think really says something about all that.</p> -->
		<br>

		<h3>Can I submit news?</h3>
		<p>If you have any news or interesting stuff related to RPI, its tech dumps, and/or the art in the tunnels, we'd
			love to feature it in a future issue!</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Can I join?</h3>
		<p>If you actually asked this question, <i>please</i> contact us at tunnelvisionweekly@proton.me and we can work
			something out!</p>
