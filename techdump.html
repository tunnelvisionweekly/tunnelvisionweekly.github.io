    <tr><td>JEC</td>                  <td>11/21/25</td>        <td> There's so many (3) printers, plus a bunch of random electronic/plastic bits.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DCC</td>                  <td>11/21/25</td>        <td>Around 10/28, there was a dump of video film and film reels! Really cool stuff IMO, super 8 and some 16mm film, plus some magnetic recording tape! Definitely worth a look. Besides that, it doesn't look like there's anything else new. There's still some kettles/coffee machines, video tapes of obscure formst, and metal boxes with electronic guts inside. Most recently, a few extra vhs tapes were found. Still not much big change, though.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>VCC</td>                  <td>11/21/25</td>        <td>A complete Core 2 Duo and 4 gb ddr3 PC (minus HDD) was found today (11/18)! Don't worry, though. At least 20 HDDs were dumped recently, all degaussed, if the 'X's are to be believed (which they typically are).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>LOW</td>                  <td>11/21/25</td>        <td>The VCC's box from over the past month or more ended up here today (11/7), there was a medium-sized PC dump the other day, the shells are still there (11/7). There are remnants of a robotic dog made by Sony, an 'aibo,' if you've heard of it. A bunch of PCs and the HEAVIEST/DENSEST cylinder I have ever seen, weighs at least 50 lbs but it's like a foot in diameter.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MRC/Cogswell</td>         <td>11/21/25</td>        <td>Cogswell still quite empty. Though the MRC is absolutely providing, there were 5 old Thinkpads found today, they all power on, too! 2x T22,1xT40, 1xT430, and 1xT20.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Other (Sage and West)</td><td>11/21/25</td>            <td>(9/30)In West, Printers, string lights, a DVD player (find of the week last semester?). There's an AC unit, some trashed laptops, and a smashed flatscreen TV. Lots of wires, too. ... (11/21) In Sage, so many wires. Go check it out if you need an ethernet cord or something. </td></tr>
