<br><h3>In a world where the tech dumps provide multitudes of tech, you have 2 choices. You can either be a collector
		of goodies you would have trouble finding elsewhere, or you can try to sell this stuff. The point of the tech dumps
		is to admire the interesting tech that runs through, and taking what you need/want, leaving the rest for others.
		In real life, don't sell this stuff. It's all free stuff for everyone, plus it's just not worth it.
		<br><br>
		In this game though, sell as much as you want! Your goal is to pay for your RPI tuition using the tech dumps!
		Get ready for some wacky situations, too! You never know what you'll find at the tech dumps!
