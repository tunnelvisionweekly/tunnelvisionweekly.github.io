		var marqText = "(Updated 11-23-25) Thank you for tuning into the official news ticker of Tunnel Vision (bi)Weekly! Latest news (Updated 11-23-25): Issue #13 is coming out around 12/8, or a week afterwards, to give us some time to catch up after break. The tech dumps have been pretty quiet lately, save for a fun Thinkpad dump in the MRC on Friday. 5 older Thinkpads from the early 2000s or so were dropped in, all mostly working! Hopefully they'll get to someone who can breathe new life into it before it all gets thrown out. Even comes with the charger! ... The cameras are still in the tunnels, best to not draw or anything there for the time being. Coverage for the Starbucks doodle book will continue nonetheless! ... Besides that, hope you all enjoy Thanksgiving break, and we'll see you afterwards! This has been the news ticker team for Tunnel Vision (bi)Weekly, thanks for tuning in, we'll see you next time! - I, Tunnel Vision (bi)Weekly, Updated 11-23-25";

Besides that, it doesn't look like there's anything else new. There's still some kettles/coffee machines, video tapes of obscure formst, and metal boxes with electronic guts inside. Most recently, a few extra vhs tapes were found. Still not much big change, though.";
